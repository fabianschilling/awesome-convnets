# Awesome Convolutional Neural Networks

A list of papers I used for my thesis about convolutional neural networks with a focus on batch normalization.

## Early work

##### [Learning Representations by Backpropagating Errors](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/naturebp.pdf) (Rumelhart et al 1986)
